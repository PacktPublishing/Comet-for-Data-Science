# Comet for Time Series Analysis

As a use case, you will use the arrivals at tourist accommodation establishments, released by Eurostat and available at [this link](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/tourism/data/database) and released under the CC BY 4.0. The dataset contains the tourist arrivals related to 42 European countries from 1990, January to 2022, April. For each country, the dataset provides details related to the type of tourism (foreign, domestic, or total), the type of accommodation, and the unit used to measure the tourist arrivals.
