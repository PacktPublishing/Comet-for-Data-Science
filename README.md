This is the code repository for [Comet for Data Science](https://www.packtpub.com/product/comet-for-data-science/9781801814430?_ga=2.159909245.190270037.1661928581-1058010958.1658349823), published by Packt.

**Enhance your ability to manage and optimize the life cycle of your data science project**

## What is this book about?
This book provides concepts and practical use cases which can be used to quickly build, monitor, and optimize data science projects. 
Using Comet, you will learn how to manage almost every step of the data science process from data collection through to creating, deploying, and monitoring a machine learning model.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Prepare for your project with the right data
* Understand the purposes of different machine learning algorithms
* Get up and running with Comet to manage and monitor your pipelines
* Understand how Comet works and how to get the most out of it
* See how you can use Comet for machine learning
* Discover how to integrate Comet with GitLab
* Work with Comet for NLP, deep learning, and time series analysis

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders.

The code will look like the following:
```
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from datetime import datetime
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for anyone who has programming experience, and wants to learn how to manage and optimize a complete data science lifecycle using Comet and other DevOps platforms. 
Although an understanding of basic data science concepts and programming concepts is needed, no prior knowledge of Comet and DevOps is required.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-11).

### Software and Hardware List

Python 3.8   Python libraries:                                                         |

Windows, macOS, or Linux If you are using macOS, please make sure that the chip is not Apple M1. To overcome this problem, you can use Google Colab	

Java SE Development Kit 17.0.2 (optional for Chapter 4, Workspaces, Projects, Experiments, and Models)    
|
Java libraries (optional for Chapter 4,|Workspaces, Projects, Experiments, and Models):
1.	comet-java-sdk-1.1.10 
    weka 3.8.6 
   
R software (optional)

R libraries (optional): 
1.	caret 
2.	cometr 

Docker

You should notice that the code examples described in Chapter 4, Workspaces, Projects, Experiments,
and Models, require a different version of Java with respect to those described in Chapter 9, Comet
for Natural Language Processing.
In addition, to make Comet work, you need to sign up to the Comet platform (https://www.comet.com/signup) and create an account.
